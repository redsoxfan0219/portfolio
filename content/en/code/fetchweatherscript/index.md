I like knowing the weather as soon as I get up in the morning. However, I don't always like poking my head outside to find out, and a simple Google search doesn't provide me all the weather details I want to know directly in the search returns page. So I wrote a Python script that gives me exactly what I want. Because I'll occasionally travel, I've set it up so that, rather than simply defaulting to my primary location, I can enter the name of the city for which I want the weather details.

In most cases, the API I'm using defaults to reporting in units that aren't intuitive to me (e.g., meters/second for wind speed). I've added a few basic functions to convert values to units I'm more familiar with. I also can never remember what the significance of the pressure readings are, so I've added a function that categorizes a pressure reading as either `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`. 

For more information on the API this script uses to retrieve current weather data, please see [this page](https://openweathermap.org/api). Keys for this API can be accessed after setting up an account. For security reasons, I've removed my API key from the script below.

```py
import requests

def get_weather():

    def kelvin_to_fahrenheit(kelvin):
        fahrenheit = ((kelvin - 273.15) * (9/5) + 32)
        return fahrenheit

    def millibar_to_inchesHg(millibars):
        inHg = millibars / 33.864
        return inHg

    def pressure_rating(inHg):
        if inHg > 30.20:
            pressure = "High Pressure"
            return pressure
        elif 29.80 <= inHg < 30.20:
            pressure = "Medium Pressure"
            return pressure
        else:
            pressure = "Low Pressure"
            return pressure 
    
    def metersPerSecond_to_MPH(metersPerSecond):
        mph = metersPerSecond * metersPerSecond
        return mph

    api_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
               
    base_url = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather'

    city = input('Enter city name: ')

    endpoint = f'{base_url}?q={city}&appid={api_key}'

    response = requests.get(endpoint)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        main = data['weather'][0]['main']
        description = data['weather'][0]['description']
        temp_kelvin = data['main']['temp']
        feels_like_kelvin = data['main']['feels_like']
        humidity = data['main']['humidity']
        wind_metric = data['wind']['speed']
        wind_speed = metersPerSecond_to_MPH(wind_metric)
        pressure_millibar = data['main']['pressure']
        pressure = millibar_to_inchesHg(pressure_millibar)
        pressure_rating = pressure_rating(pressure)
        temp = kelvin_to_fahrenheit(temp_kelvin)
        feels_like = kelvin_to_fahrenheit(feels_like_kelvin)

        print(f'Primary Weather: {main}')
        print(f'Description: {description}')
        print(f'Humidity: {humidity}%')
        print(f'Temperature: {temp:.1f}째F')
        print(f'Feels like: {feels_like:.1f}째F')
        print(f'Wind speed: {wind_speed:.1f} mph')
        print(f'Pressure: {pressure:.2f} inchesHg: {pressure_rating}')
        
    else: 
        error_code = response.status_code
        print(f'There was a {error_code} error')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    get_weather()

```

Here's a sample output for my primary location, `Columbus` :

```
Weather: Clouds
Description: overcast clouds
Humidity: 46%
Temperature: 44.7째F
Feels like: 41.6째F
Wind speed: 6.6 mph
Pressure: 29.94 inchesHg: Medium Pressure
```
