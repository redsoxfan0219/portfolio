Below is an example of AI-ML documentation that I've created in the past. The content of this text is designed meet expectations set in the [Federal Reserve's SR 11-7: Guidance on Model Risk Management](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.htm).

Note: all proprietary details have been removed and the specific model attributes have been genericized.

## Model Overview

### Model Purpose

The purpose of Super Fantastic Superior Sample Weather Model (herafter "Sample Weather" or "the model") is to predict Fantastic Insurance Co.'s claim losses and loss frequencies following a catastrophic ("CAT") wind-rain event, such as a hurricane.

Currently, when a severe weather event occurs, Fantastic Insurance actuaries produce loss and frequencies estimates by reviewing past wind-rain events and  applying a multiplication factor to the cost and frequencies of the previous event. This approach has proven ineffective at gauging losses and frequencies, especially when the present event differs dramatically in size and location from past wind-rain events.

The goal of the Sample Weather model is to use advancend analytics technicques to a) predict losses and frequencies more accurately; b) produce predictions more quickly than current practice allows; and c) to continue producing predictions for the 30 days following a wind-rain event.
